    m_Localized: "In the heart of Cartagena, the walled city, where the cobblestone
      streets tell stories of centuries past, lived a passionate poet named Luis.
      Luis, with his gaze always fixed on the horizon of the Caribbean Sea, found
      inspiration in every corner of the city that he loved with all his being.\r\n\r\nOne
      day, as the sun woke up over the turquoise waters, Luis woke up with a brilliant
      idea. He ran to the window of his abode, opened the heavy curtains and allowed
      the golden light to flood into his room. The smell of the sea, the salty breeze
      and the song of the seagulls flooded his soul. The poet felt that the magic
      of Cartagena enveloped him, and a deep inspiration invaded him.\r\n\r\nHe hurriedly
      dressed and walked down the stairs of his pastel-colored building. Carts carrying
      fruit and sweets traveled along the narrow cobblestone streets, and the bustle
      of the city intensified as the morning progressed. As he walked, Luis recited
      aloud his poem, an ode to the beauty and resilience of Cartagena, a love song
      to his homeland.\r\n\r\nSome passersby looked at him in disbelief, not understanding
      the purpose of his words. Others, however, stopped to listen, captivated by
      the passion in his voice and the images he painted with his verses. As Luis
      walked through the streets, his poem acted like a spell, touching the hearts
      of those who were willing to listen.\r\n\r\nAt a corner near Bol\xEDvar Park,
      Luis stopped. There, surrounded by a group of people who were listening attentively,
      he recited the final verse of his poem:\r\n\r\n\"But today, full of stale disarray,\r\nyou
      may well inspire that affection\r\nWhat do you have to your old shoes...\"\r\n\r\nSome
      applauded, others cried, and a solemn silence descended upon the crowd. The
      connection between Luis and his city was palpable, and his poem became an unofficial
      anthem of Cartagena, reminding everyone that, despite historical adversity,
      his city remained a jewel full of life. and culture.\r\n\r\nOver time, this
      poet honored his poem in a special way. A group of talented sculptors sculpted
      magnificent giant boots in bronze that represented the strength and beauty
      of Cartagena. These boots were erected in a prominent place in the center of
      the city, where they rested until their demolition, a monument that symbolized
      resilience and Cartagena pride, rose from its ashes to become a meeting point
      for the inhabitants of Cartagena, a constant reminder that, like those beloved
      old shoes, the city would always be with them, ready to be appreciated and
      loved, no matter what adversities it faced along the way. Luis's poetry and
      his deep love for Cartagena had become an indelible part of the city's history
      and culture."

    m_Localized: "There is no complete clarity about the origin of the name of this
      place, the story closest to reality is that at the time when Cartagena did
      not have an airport, the Bah\xEDa de las Animas was used as the landing gear
      for hydroplanes. that had the mark \u201CPegasus\u201D written on their wings.
      The people of Cartagena, from reading this so much, called the dock \u201Cof
      the Pegasus\u201D until it officially adopted this name. It is a quite credible
      version since the people of Cartagena have an old custom.\r\nGive the name
      you like to places, objects and animals.\r\nIn 1920, the Municipal Council
      decided to remodel the old dock built in 1791, called La Bodeguita at the end
      of the 19th century and which served for coastal ships to dock since 1900.
      After the remodeling it was officially named \u201CPegasus Dock.\u201D \u201D,
      and the statues of the Pegasus were placed to represent the spirit of the city,
      originally made by the Cartagena Miguel Caballero Leclerc and ordered to be
      made by the president of the ladies of the city;\r\n\r\nIn 1992, after the
      deterioration of the original statues, the sculptor H\xE9ctor Lombana donated
      the current sculptures that are in the place to the walled city."

    m_Localized: 'Once upon a time there was a brave English soldier who stood in
      front of the imposing walls of Cartagena. The mission that had been entrusted
      to him was to conquer Castillo San Felipe, a name that honors King Felipe IV,
      a fortress that represented a great challenge for any army. As he approached
      the castle, he could feel the agony and tension in the air.

      

      The
      soldier, whose name is unknown, in the distance could see the colonial surroundings
      of Cartagena, with which he was fascinated and which he could barely perceive.
      The colonial architecture, the cobblestone streets and the colorful buildings
      aroused his admiration, which fueled his desire for conquest. But not only
      that, he also fell in love with the exuberant nature that surrounded him on
      his way to the impenetrable walls.

      

      As he advanced, the soldier
      encountered a variety of wild and exotic animals. Although some were dangerous,
      such as poisonous snakes and jaguars, they were also beautiful and majestic
      in their own way. The duality between the danger and the beauty of these animals
      reflected the difficult situation of the soldier.

      

      As he approached
      the castle, the soldier faced numerous obstacles. The walls were imposing and
      seemed unbreakable. The sound of gunshots and the explosion of cannons filled
      the air, increasing the tension and agony the soldier felt.

      

      Unfortunately,
      despite the bravery and determination of the English soldier and his army,
      they did not manage to get close enough to Castillo San Felipe. The beauty
      that they admired so much became his worst enemy, since it was the cause of
      his failure.

      

      As they advanced through the natural environment
      of Cartagena, the English army began to face a series of unforeseen challenges.
      Unknown diseases spread rapidly through the ranks, decimating soldiers and
      weakening their ability to fight.

      

      In addition, they encountered
      wild animals that attacked them fiercely. Jaguars, poisonous snakes, and other
      predators lurked in the dense vegetation surrounding the castle, making it
      impossible to advance without suffering significant casualties.

      

      But
      that was not all. Nature itself seemed to conspire against him. Hidden traps,
      such as muddy swamps and unstable terrain, lay in their path, trapping the
      soldiers and making their progress difficult. The beauty of the surroundings
      had become a deadly deception.

      

      The English army, weakened
      and harassed by the dangers of nature, was forced to retreat. The mystery surrounding
      the army''s defeat remained to this day, with various theories and hypotheses
      regarding the exact reasons for its failure.

      

      In the end, the
      story of the English soldier and his army in Cartagena became a tragedy. His
      love for the beauty of the colonial environment and his desire to conquer Castillo
      San Felipe led them to their downfall, facing diseases, wild animals and the
      natural traps that nature had prepared for them.

      

      Since its
      construction in 1657, Castillo San Felipe has referred to the beauty of Cartagena
      and the unbreakable spirit of the city.'

    m_Localized: "In the year 1704, the engineer Juan Herrara undertook a restoration
      work that would mark a milestone in the history of this walled city, which
      keeps secrets and legends in each of its centuries-old stones.\r\n\r\nThe adventure
      begins at the \"Puerta del Puente\", a structure that dates back to 1631 and
      which, in its time, represented the main entrance to the city. This majestic
      gate was linked to a wooden bridge that dated back to 1540, a viaduct suspended
      in the air that extended over the Cano de San Anastasio. This saltwater channel
      separated the island of Gethsemane from the island of Calamari, creating a
      picturesque landscape that today is home to the sea breeze and the most enchanting
      sunsets in the region.\r\n\r\nThe \"Puerta del Puente\" was not only a vital
      access to the city, but also a symbol of the strength of Cartagena. However,
      as in any history of struggle and resistance, this gate suffered its share
      of challenges. It was partially destroyed on one occasion by the fearsome Bernard
      Desjean, Baron de Pointis, whose name still echoes in the dark passages of
      the city's history. But the perseverance and determination of the inhabitants
      of Cartagena never wavered.\r\n\r\nNow, as we stroll through the cobblestone
      streets and listen to the gentle murmur of the waves of the Caribbean Sea,
      we can appreciate the majesty of this restored gate. Imagine the sounds of
      hammers and saws echoing in the narrow streets as the artisans and workers
      of the time strove to restore it to its splendor. What we hear now are only
      a distant echo of those days, but they transport us to a time when determination
      and passion for the preservation of history guided the brave people of Cartagena
      in their mission.\r\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at the present day, where the \"Puerta
      del Puente\" \u201Cclock wall\u201D is affectionately known as \u201CThe Clock
      Tower\u201D. This name change reflects the importance of the structure in modern
      life in Cartagena. The Clock Tower has become an iconic symbol of the city,
      a welcome to the historic center that attracts visitors from all over the world.\r\n\r\nSo,
      as you pass through the Clock Tower and walk through the cobblestone streets
      of Cartagena, remember the rich history that lies behind this majestic structure.
      Each brick, each stone, each detail tells a story of bravery and perseverance
      throughout the centuries, a story that remains alive in the heart of this beautiful
      city."

    m_Localized: 'Once upon a time, in colonial times, there was an indigenous girl
      whose destiny would become intertwined with the history of a continent. This
      girl, named Catalina, was the niece of main chiefs in her indigenous town.
      Her life began with the promise of a prosperous future, but fate had other
      plans.

      

      Catherine lived in a land of unparalleled beauty, where
      the customs and religion of her people flourished in harmony with nature. However,
      at a time when the Spanish arrived in America with their desire for conquest
      and conversion to Christianity, Catherine''s world was turned upside down.
      She was kidnapped by the conquistadors and torn from her homeland, a terrifying
      experience for a girl who barely understood what was happening.

      

      Little
      Catalina was taken to Santo Domingo, where she began a new life under Spanish
      customs and religion. Despite the harsh education she received from her, which
      sought to transform her into another Spanish, Catalina never forgot her roots.
      Her heart continued to beat to the rhythm of the ancient songs of her people,
      and her indomitable spirit was never completely broken.

      

      As
      Catalina grew up, she became a singular figure. Unlike many other indigenous
      people who were enslaved and subjugated, she stood out for her dedication to
      evangelization, even in her own hometown of Zamba. While the Spanish viewed
      Catherine as a traitor to her own culture, she saw her mission as an act of
      redemption for her ''apostate'' people. She became a beacon of hope for those
      who longed to preserve her ancestral traditions and beliefs.

      

      But
      Catalina''s life was never without challenges. She faced the corruption and
      betrayal of Pedro de Heredia, a man with whom she shared intimacies but who
      did not share her ethical convictions. Catalina did not hesitate to denounce
      Heredia''s corruption, despite the pain this caused her.

      

      As
      the years passed, Catalina found herself alone in Cartagena de Indias. But
      her legacy endured throughout the centuries. In the current millennium, she
      is remembered as a symbol of pride and culture. Her story, full of conflict
      and sacrifice, reminds us of the complexity of the colonial era and the bravery
      of those who dared to defy circumstances.

      

      The statue of Catalina,
      erected in Cartagena de Indias in 1974, represents the woman she was, a grown
      Indian with the appearance that we may secretly long for. She refused to be
      forcibly removed from her land, and her indomitable spirit became a beacon
      of hope for her people and for all those seeking to understand the complexity
      of American history. Catalina, the indigenous girl who became a symbol of redemption
      and resistance, lives in the hearts of all those who remember her with admiration
      and respect.

      But also, it is understandable that there are ill-wishers
      of India. Catalina does not know what to do with the pain that her miscegenation
      causes them or with the loneliness of independence. For some, Catalina was
      considered a traitor, an Indian who abandoned her people and adapted to Spanish
      customs and religion. Her life was marked by controversy, and her haters see
      her as someone who lost her indigenous identity in search of acceptance among
      the colonizers.

      

      However, what we cannot understand is that
      Catherine was not a simple victim of her time, but a complex figure torn between
      two worlds. Her story is a testament to the difficult decisions she had to
      make in a time of deep cultural and religious conflict. Catalina, the kidnapped
      Indian woman who became a symbol of pride and culture, remains an enigma to
      those who try to define her in simple terms. Her legacy reminds us that history
      is full of nuances and that the truth is not always found in black and white.'
